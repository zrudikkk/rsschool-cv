### About me: 
I studied 6 years for lawyer and a year ago began my career. This profession provides a lot of ways to reach your goals but still there is no certainty in the final result. That is why i decided to change my life. At school i was good enough at math and programming in Pascal so i think it is a good idea to go back to the roots. I am highly motivated because i like to find ways to solve complex problems and become very happy when i can deal with it. Unfortunately i have no experience in front-end but i will do my best to become better.
